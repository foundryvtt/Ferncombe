The fourth Thomas Franklin to be raised in the town, he was somewhat of an anomaly among a family known mostly for grifting, swindling, and otherwise making money in spurious or questionable ways. His father (now referred to in local tradition as 'poor old Franklin') was arrested in a neighboring city for sheep stealing when Thomas was a young man, and watching the outcome of such a life had profound effect on him.</p><p>\"The worst of it\" Old Franklin might tell those who'll listen, \"wasn't the sheep stealing that got him hanged— it was all the things the man did that they <em>didn't </em>catch him for.\"</p><p>After his father's sentence was carried out, he set out from Ferncombe intent on finding his way in the world. Returning some years later with stories of high society and the importance of gentlemanly kindness set him apart from the rest of Ferncombe which, for the most part, hadn't been touched by noble ideas of station and status for years. Thomas had spent much of his time amongst the traders and merchants who catered to a 'more civilized' clientele, and took away many important lessons about how to run a successful business…but never quite grasped the most important of all: knowing your audience.</p><p>On his return to Ferncombe, then still a young man, he established Franklin's Weavers, Tailors, and Haberdashery—which failed due in no small part to lack of interest. He reopened the business a few months after its failing as Franklin's Fine Foods and Imported Foodstuffs— which failed due to the exorbitant prices required to import foods from far away countries for a town which had no palate for them. His attempts to launch a business continued through no less than seven iterations until he finally found the right balance in Franklin's Sundries—a store that, he assured the townsfolk, would always have everything they might ever want.</p><p>Franklin has worked his entire life to build a reputation for himself as a compassionate, caring, polite, and forthright man.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":900000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"ferncombe.FerncombeJournalSheet"}}},{"name":"Thomas Franklin Jr.","type":"text","_id":"oAwiNskO7s2CtyVc","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Thomas Franklin (Junior) is a 28 year old, chaotic-good male human (bandit).</p><h3>Appearance</h3><p>Young Franklin carries himself with all the energy of a gambler stumbling from a dingy basement card game into the grim light of day. His clothing seems perpetually rumpled, shoulder-length hair hastily finger-combed, he wears a few days of unshorn facial scruff, and he often has an expression somewhere between surprise and confusion.</p><h3>Personality</h3><p>As hard as he might try, Young Franklin is simply not his father. Old Franklin's insistence on the importance of reputation was something that never held with Thomas Jr. and it shows in nearly everything he does. His manner is polite and friendly, and his exuberance in dealing with potential clients shines through whenever he meets someone new. Above all, Young Franklin loves to sell— he is at his most positive when meeting new people but some people find him to be off-putting, like a snake oil salesman. He isn't malicious, but interactions with him feel somehow slimy.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Young Franklin is not something of a pillar in the community in Ferncombe. The fifth Thomas Franklin to be raised in Ferncombe has a reputation as something of a wild card compared to his fathers' gentlemanly way. Franklin Jr. spent a lot of his life trying his best to to fill his fathers' shoes, but years of poor decisions in his childhood have saddled him with a reputation he simply cannot shake.</p><p>When he was younger, Thomas' proclivities for gambling and scheming saw him branded by the town as rake— always more willing to drink and gamble than he was to do any real work. Due in no small part to his desire for fatherly approval, Thomas' had many stuttering early forays into entrepreneurial spirit that didn't quite hit the mark. <em>Wild Tom's Fine Spirits, </em>his first failed business, sought to corner the local alcohol production market by utilizing portable stills that could be set up in nearby fields and hills— but lack of investment in material quality and lack of knowledge of local herbs produced spirits that might only ever have had apothecarial value. Wild Tom's Hillside Gin still lives in infamy as being the best paint stripper for boats amongst the Ginz family. <em>Fine Spirits </em>suffered a catastrophic failure in its first year when Tom dozed off on a hillside while awaiting completion of a distillation— the resultant explosion was heard as far away as the town wharf, and pieces of the still are still occasionally being fished from the river. This was only the beginning of a trend for failed businesses, but Thomas' mistakes far exceeded those of his father, and where Old Franklin finally learned the right balance in establishing Franklin's Sundries, Young Franklin never will.</p><p>Over the years, Old Franklin has funded numerous startup businesses for his son, perpetually encouraging him to succeed— but not standing in the way of his failures when they happened. His father allowing him to fail on his own merits has bred no small amount of resentment in Young Franklin.</p><p>A short list of Thomas' failed endeavors:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Wild Tom's Fine Spirits</strong> - Lack of research and investment resulted in poor tasting moonshine, lack of attention resulted in explosion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tom's Fine Preserves</strong> - Centered around the idea of providing long term preservation of fruit and vegetables, Tom never quite understood the importance of sanitizing and sealing the jars.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tom's Finest Soaps</strong> - Myrdina tried to warn him, she really did, but his very first batch mistook a weed with an abrasive and irritating sap for a common sweet-smelling flower and the resulting bars of soap were wholly unusable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tom's River Transport</strong> - The most recent debacle, Tom stopped trying to use \"fine\" in the business name and just sought simplicity. He would rent boats to those looking to ship goods or travel down river as a more efficient way than travelling on land. It wasn't. The river flows too rapidly in places, Tom was renting the boats himself and re-renting at a markup, and the river isn't big enough for the kind of barges needed to transport farm goods.</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":925000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"ferncombe.FerncombeJournalSheet"}}},{"name":"Skipper Ginz","type":"text","_id":"adY1gf0dUcenHugc","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Skipper is a 35 year old neutral-good male kobold.</p><h3>Appearance</h3><p>Skipper has tan and brown scales mottled with dots of light blue.

Her father Janulf spent most of his time tinkering and doing handyman jobs in passing towns, never settling in one place—and he passed his knack for metalwork onto his daughter. From a young age the girl seemed to have a knack for understanding metallurgy, and she could mend pots and pans without burning herself before she could read.</p><p>Through a series of complex social introductions, Lileja's talent for metalwork found her bound as apprentice to a famed blacksmith whose weapons and armor can still be found in some of the most wealthy households and tournaments. However, the world is not a kind place, and for a woman in a \"man's trade\", especially one tending to the needs of high society, it is especially unkind.</p><p>As a journeyman, she found her way to the town of Ferncombe, having remembered it from her travelling childhood, and settled in to a satisfying and quiet life. One absent the entanglements or burdens of social niceties. The townsfolk see her as friendly enough in her way— but most give her a wide berth unless they need farrier work or tools repaired.

While he loves nothing more than talking to strangers that might wander through town, he can often be found passing parts of his day at one odd job or another, helping thatch a roof or till a field, sharing tea on a porch or carrying goods for the elderly. His friendliness and willingness to engage with others make it easy to see why he's well liked in all parts of the community.</span></p><p><span data-text=\"true\">Tur's voice is the kind of loud and booming that might come from years of parade ground shouting, or might have come from truly ordering troops in battle.

It wasn't the swift dispatching of bandits that wore Tur down, he seemed to take a particular relish the act of facing the wanton cruelty of banditry, and certainly the word of \"The Great Sword\" and what it would mean if you were caught by him spread far and wide—no, what drove Tur to retirement were the 'peace-keeping' contracts that meant protecting some merchant's grain stores from the poor and the hungry.</span></p><p>Though he would never tell another soul what event caused him to leave the life of a mercenary soldier behind him, it was grim enough that it left a mark on him that he works to this day to leave behind. Little is known about the half-decade that Tur spent wandering after leaving the mercenary company, but the man that came to settle and retire in Ferncombe was unrecognizable from the deadly, bandit-slaying warrior that once ranged far and wide.</p><p>In Ferncombe, Tur quickly became a pillar of the community, a friend to nearly every person in the town, a protector, a captain of the guard, and eventually a town councilor responsible for advising on the best ways to safeguard the town itself.</p><section id=\"secret-nvvNkgbICOGMUqbj\" class=\"secret\"><p><span data-text=\"true\">Tur has given some thought to settling down and starting a family, but it is a passing fancy and not one of his driving characteristics.

He is reluctant to engage others in romance, reminded perhaps of the family that was once taken from him.

Between permanent inhabitants of Ferncombe and temporary (extended) guests, they can number a dozen or more at any one time. Skipper cheerfully welcomes even the most distant of relatives with all the hospitality he can muster, and the town have come to see the clan as an inexorable part of their settlement's character.</p><h3>The Kobold Clan</h3><p><strong>Skemp</strong> is a long-limbed, bony little kobold with silver-trimmed scales and almost too many teeth. He is quick to smile, and every tries to get him to eat more. He usually wears custom-tailored pants and a vest, which always seem way too big for him.</p><p><strong>Sprek</strong> is short, plump, and paints her scales in different colors every few weeks. She's young and mouthy, but good natured. She works as a seamstress, and is without the best dressed kobold in town, and perhaps the world.</p><p><strong>Skindle</strong> is Skemp's son, he is tiny, and always slightly wet or slippery and nobody is sure why. He has bright blue eyes and loves raw fish. Skindle couldn't be paid to wear clothing. The clan is working on him.</p><p><strong>Red</strong> is a rotund little kobold with a wide snout, red-tinged scales. He never sits still and has a mean disposition the clan is trying to train out of him. He only ever wears a floppy cap and a big burlap smock, no matter how dirty either of them are. Washing them is an ordeal.</p><p><strong>Kork</strong> is Red's sister, and has red-purple scales along with a big gap-toothed smile. She's affable and goofy, and gets on famously with other kids. She dresses like the other kids in town as an effort to fit in, which she does admirably.</p><p><strong>Shak</strong> is Red and Kork's father, and Skipper's brother. He has fiery red-orange scales, and eyes so bright they almost glow. He's hard-nosed and serious. He tends to the hatchlings with ferocity and unwavering care. He wears little in the way of clothing, and is something of a traditionalist compared to the others in the clan.</p><p><strong>Slola</strong> is pretty by kobold standards, with sleek green scales and emerald eyes. She's a bit of a weirdo, and collects bugs to eat and study. She wears overalls and her pockets always have a dead bug or too freshly captured that day. A pouch full of little corked jars hangs off her shoulder.</p><p><strong>Fynn</strong> is a long-tailed kobold with blue-trimmed scales, he loves wearing silver jewelry which all of his money is spent on. He is friendly and kind, and always ready to help out. He is a skilled fisherman, and often works with Skipper to provide the day's catch. He wears a wide-brimmed straw hat and a poncho with interesting patterns, which is only one of many that he owns.</p><p><strong>Twig</strong> is a skinny, tall kobold with blue-trimmed scales. He is very girlish in his mannerisms, and is often mistaken for a female by outsiders that don't know better. He is a talented dancer, often teaching other kids in town new dances he's made up. He likes bright colors and copper jewelry, often creating flower crowns and necklaces to accent his otherwise plain clothing.</p><p><strong>Dreggory</strong> is a burly kobold with serious brown eyes. He is a softy at heart, and very quiet. He is an excellent fisherman, and works with the others to keep the clan fed. He wears a vest over a raggedy sweater which hides a harness of whatever items he needs for the day, allowing him to reach under his sweater and produce anything from lures to snacks, which confuse and delight those around him.</p><p><strong>Namma</strong> is the clan mom, and is respected (and feared) by all within it. She has tan scales, and is an excellent cook. She likes to wear lots of jewelry, and often wears old dresses that she's mended and patched. She is always ready with a kind word and a shoulder to cry on, or a wooden spoon with which to deliver justice.</p><p><strong>Jemi</strong> is Skipper's nephew, and is an apprentice fisherman. He also works in the shop, and is being trained as a jeweler. He has brown scales, and is very curt. He doesn't like to talk much, but he is a hard worker.</p><p><strong>Rimi</strong> is Jemi's brother, and the two of them constantly bicker. Despite that, they have a good hearted relationship. Rimi is mouthy, and likes to talk. He is also very green, always getting himself into trouble due to lack of experience with fishing. Skipper is trying to teach him, but he might not have the patience for it.</p><p><strong>Klem</strong> is a wild and unhinged kobold, who is always hyper. She has brown and black scales, and hates birds. She loves to climb things, and is always getting into trouble for doing so. She wears an old tarp that she's cut holes into to serve as a makeshift poncho.</p><p><strong>Ralu</strong> is serious looking kobold with gray-blue scales. Outwardly she is always polite to the other townsfolk, and internally is a fierce and protective mother to Red and Kork. She is a good cook, and often makes meals for the clan alongside Namma.</p><p><strong>Fimski</strong> can regularly spotted cleaning and cutting fish at the shop, or tying nets in his spare time. Nobody is quite sure if he is mute, as he never speaks, but he seems to understand everything that is said to him. He has blue-trimmed scales and a short tail. He always wears an old hat with a fish knife tucked into the band.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":884571,"name":"The Bogg Family","type":"text","_id":"KMr83uy24Xctrihn","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Claire Waters married Walken Bogg.

For a long time Albert tried to ingratiate himself to her, but his nature is simply too much like a politician to win out. From time to time he tries to do something nice for her, or to bring her the news, but the visits are curt, short, and he has grown weary of being rebuffed.

He'd rather the kobolds be moved on from the wharf—but the townsfolk have spoken in that regard: the Ginz family might walk a fine line bordering on becoming scoundrels, but they're the town's scoundrels. Albert is never one to push against the tide, so he tries to make Skipper and the rest of the kobolds feel welcome, but it's mostly hollow words. Skipper knows it, too—but he plays the game and does his part not to rock the boat.</p><p>@UUID[.ibNobrbIosJbxjAs]{Thomas Franklin Sr.} - Albert is old enough to remember the return of Thomas Franklin (Sr.) and at least some of the string of businesses that launched the now successful general store. He's always had a fondness for the old trader, and quietly views him as a sort of wizened role-model. He makes an effort at least twice a week to pass the time with Old Franklin, playing chess and drinking tea and musing on the town's troubles.</p><p>@UUID[.oAwiNskO7s2CtyVc]{Thomas Franklin Jr.} - Though they were never close enough in age to run in the same social circles, Young Franklin was someone that Albert admired—a young, adventurous sort. Albert thinks of Young Franklin as very much the kind of man he would have wanted to be if he had ever screwed up enough courage to do the risky thing. Alas, the mayor simply isn't that man. For a short time in his youth he let himself be pulled into some of Young Franklin's hare-brained schemes, and they held a loyal friendship for a while. Unlike his friendship with Mette, who was a positive influence on his life and who he remained connect to, his relationship with Thomas courted disaster on many occasion. The two were never extremely close, and and still aren't, but each still views the other as a friend they could count on if they needed one.</p><p>@UUID[.jEwfmvZv0z5uNRjc]{Tur Thorndrake} - Mayor Glinn didn't quite know what to make of the dragonborn when he first appeared in town— a disheveled wreck of a road-weary soldier carrying a battered sword bigger than he'd ever seen…but one which was smiling, caring, friendly. As Tur made a place for himself and settled into Ferncombe's way of life, however, it became clear that their goals aligned very closely. When Tur offered to start training townsfolk up into a militia to defend themselves, he knew they'd never be separated.

For all the years they been in town they might as well be strangers.</p><p>@UUID[.nkbJ7gW5AKK78gCX]{Matilde \"Mette\" Eswich} - Mette is a fixture in the bar so often that Cait has reserved a stool at the end of the bar for her. Every day, almost without fail, Councilor Eswich is on station to take lunch, and her and Cait often spend time together around dinner, sharing a drink and the gossip of the day.

Out of respect of some agreement between Franklin and her father, or perhaps because she feels bad taking so much of Young Franklin's money, Cait rarely charges the elder Franklin.</p><p>@UUID[.oAwiNskO7s2CtyVc]{Thomas Franklin Jr.} - Young Franklin has had occasion to get himself thrown out of Cait's rest, including, at times, week long bans. It isn't that he is a particularly rough customer, or terribly handsy with Cait or the waitstaff, but he's a morose drunk and if she'd let him he'd be drunk constantly.

At some point in the past during one of Albert's efforts to \"improve the town\" he tried to issue a ordnance against noise—one which would have limited Lileja to only working during a narrow shortly after the sun rose until dinner time. It was the very last time she stuck her head into the town's politics, and the blistering rebuke she delivered in the middle of the street is a story that still gets told from time to time—just never when Albert is around to hear it.</p><p>@UUID[.uOAPIMRCvFulZBZv]{Caitlin Cartwright} - In the exceedingly rare times Lileja ventures into town for some small amount of socialization, she can be found in a quiet corner of Cait's Rest.

Periodically the councilor will pass through and request another horse be shod, or will ask about one sick animal or another and though she would never admit it, Lileja enjoys hearing the stories Mette has to tell about the periodic mischief she stirs, told while the halfling trims a forelock or tends wounded cattle.</p><p>@UUID[.adY1gf0dUcenHugc]{Skipper Ginz} - When not working her forge, she can be found enjoying a smoking pipe, sitting out on the dock in town.

Despite that, she has managed to find equilibrium with him, where neither waste each other's time in matters of business, and both proved that their word was good as any contract. This allowed them to develop a terse but positive rapport.</p><p>@UUID[.oAwiNskO7s2CtyVc]{Thomas Franklin Jr.} - If there's one person Lileja adamantly dislikes in town it is Young Franklin, and she isn't subtle if his name is brought up. A few months ago, Young Franklin tried to solicit credit from her, banking on the Franklin name for a project she shrewdly pointed out was sure to be a failure, and he followed up by offering to sell her steel at Franklin's sundries in a way that implied she couldn't possibly be doing enough business at Hot Iron. Heated words were exchanged—some quite loudly. The ruction came to its conclusion with Lileja barring Young Franklin from all future patronage unless Old Franklin himself arrived to undersign. For his part, Young Franklin keeps away from Hot Iron and will actively avoid contact with Lileja if it can at all be helped.</p><p>@UUID[.jEwfmvZv0z5uNRjc]{Tur Thorndrake} - Tur and Lileja have a purely transactional relationship—when he needs something he arrives with cash in hand, or at least has never stiffed her on a bill come due.

It isn't that the woman is reckless, because that implies a lack of caution, instead, she often makes the calculated choice to take the path she feels to be more exciting. For all that, Albert remains one of her closest friends, the steadying lighthouse in the stormy seas of her life, and though they were never romantically involved that didn't stop her from sewing rumors in the town to that effect…and, for that matter, after Albert was wed to Abigail, that she and Abigail had been involved in a torrid love affair as well.</p><p>@UUID[.uOAPIMRCvFulZBZv]{Caitlin Cartwright} - Cait is one of Mette's most adored friends, a fact that was a source of endless consternation to Oden while he was alive. Though Cait never followed Mette into any trouble that they couldn't get out of—her unashamed nature and impulsive behavior exposed Cait to near-constant controversy and rumor that no amount of effort on Oden's part could quell.

Yet as she aged, wandered, came back—-it was clear that something changed, and Myrdina was growing out of the wildness that she held in her heart. She still enjoys the apothecary's company, but their time apart has caused them to grow apart and, though they still count one another as friends, the spark that made that friendship special has faded to a dull ember.</p><p>@UUID[.adY1gf0dUcenHugc]{Skipper Ginz} - Mette positively loves the idea of a family of kobolds being accepted into the quaint village she grew up in, and has been the voice in opposition to any criticism of the creatures amongst the town's small council. She has been a staunch ally to Skipper and the Ginz brood.</p><p>@UUID[.ibNobrbIosJbxjAs]{Thomas Franklin Sr.} - While it would be fair to say that Mette has nothing against Old Franklin, she finds his dedication to decorum stifling and has no particular interest in association with him beyond one of a transactional nature. She knows he disapproves of her friendship with Thomas Junior—and if she were being honest with herself, she couldn't care less.</p><p>@UUID[.oAwiNskO7s2CtyVc]{Thomas Franklin Jr.} - There are many in town who are certain that Mette has been courting, or at least bedding, Young Franklin for years—but it's easier to count the people that Mette is not rumored to have bedded. With her being the source of such rumors on frequent occasion, it's near impossible to discern the truth of the matter. However, Mette's friendship with Thomas has been no more, or no or less, platonic than her involvement with Cait, Albert, or Abigail. Thomas is easily influenced and Mette enjoys that fact thoroughly, serving as an enabler for the more rakish nature of the young would-be merchant at every opportunity.</p><p>@UUID[.jEwfmvZv0z5uNRjc]{Tur Thorndrake} - Mette is intrigued by her dragonborn fellow councilor- perhaps more intrigued than she is with most travelers who come through…her interest is far from simple curiosity in Tur's case, though. During a particular night of drinking the dragonborn dropped a casual mention of his previous mercenary life—the name the bandits he slew knew him by— and Mette has been trying to unravel the truth of his background ever since. Clever enough to not ask directly, she has simply been piecing the truth together from his numerous embellished stories. She doesn't hold it against him that he hides that part of his life—nor would she use the truth to leverage him—but in revealing to her that he was a riddle, she feels obligated to solve him. The two share an easy friendship, and can often be found walking together in rare moments where Mette isn't positively alive with energy.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"ferncombe.FerncombeJournalSheet"}}},{"sort":885547,"name":"Connections","type":"text","_id":"H1Brgfut56MnujHW","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>@UUID[.hRtimGuKCKAdL05h]{Albert Glinn} - There's not much that the sarcastic apothecary has to say about Albert, as she doesn't find him terribly remarkable.

Through the years these two families have remained close, despite troubles on both sides.</p><p>@UUID[.adY1gf0dUcenHugc]{Skipper Ginz} - Having to set aside his urban prejudices with Skipper was a personal trial that Thomas tackled with humility, and worked his hardest to find an adequate arrangement that would suit both men without the other feeling they were being taken advantage of.

When Franklin was first striking out with some of his more risky ventures and gambles, he and Albert formed a chance, but risky friendship, and Thomas feels bad for having taken money from the now mayor only to waste it—but it isn't as though he didn't suffer losses himself. They held a loyal friendship for a while, but drifted apart as Albert began his more political machinations. For all that, the two count one another as friends, and Thomas knows he can lean on the mayor for assistance and support in a time of need.</p><p>@UUID[.uOAPIMRCvFulZBZv]{Caitlin Cartwright} - Thomas has some small amount of infatuation with Cait, but the spark he sees there exists only in his imagination. Though they grew up only a couple years apart in age, their interests differed too much in their youth for them to form a strong friendship. Cait's claiming of Oden's Rest in her own name gave him a more comfortable place to drink and some welcome companionship, but her manner toward him even now is more sisterly than romantic. He enjoys Cait's company all the same, and can often be found at the bar when he isn't otherwise occupied—or when Cait specifically tells him he's cut off to sober up. He doesn't hold it against her.</p><p>@UUID[.hG46SU0MlF900kRp]{Lileja Horsetender} - Young Franklin knows that he fumbled chances of a positive social relationship with Lileja recently, and has accepted that. Looking at it objectively, he'd admit candidly that the gruff halfling woman was probably never going to like him for one reason or another—a fact which she would, amusingly, find endearing if she ever heard it. Thomas is used to not being liked, and knows that there plenty of people for whom his particular charm reads more as sleazy than endearing.</p><p>@UUID[.nkbJ7gW5AKK78gCX]{Matilde \"Mette\" Eswich} - If he were tasked to use an adjective to describe Mette he would use the word \"dangerous\", and laugh about it. Over the years, Mette has taken more loose money, favours, and clothing from Thomas in friendly card and dice games than any three other townsfolk combined. They play cards some nights in Cait's rest, other times on the wharf with Skipper, and more often in private games at one house or another in the village. The bets are never high stakes, and though on more than one occasion Thomas has found himself having to sneak home through darkened streets in nothing but his smallclothes, he and Mette count one another as friends and he never turns down a chance to get back some of his money.</p><p>@UUID[.adY1gf0dUcenHugc]{Skipper Ginz} - Thomas was one of the first people in town to recognize the value of the Ginz brood and Skipper in particular, and the two are, to this day, very close friends.</p><p>Though it isn't well known, Young Franklin was the one who helped Skipper get his modest business set up on the wharf in the first place. After awaking one particularly hungover morning to find himself on the wharf being prodded by a cluster of Kobolds, Thomas didn't have the energy to panic or flee and so engaged them in conversation, learning of Skipper's prowess as a fisher. Even Thomas doesn't clearly remember where he got the meager sum that he used for starting capital to give to Skipper, but he quietly counts the investment as his first, actual, successful business venture. Years of failed opportunities have taught Thomas that it would be better not to reveal his involvement in the business until it has well and truly succeeded, however. Skipper repaid the tidy debt in record time, and it remains a tidy secret between the two.</p><p>When he isn't working or spending his hours at Cait's rest or in some small gambling den, he's often on the wharf carousing with Skipper.</p><p>@UUID[.ibNobrbIosJbxjAs]{Thomas Franklin Sr.} - The relationship between Thomas and his father is strained. Young Franklin resents his father's apparent ease of success, and more so the fact that Old Franklin often lets his business ideas fail on their merits. It has caused somewhat of a rift between the two in recent years, but deep down Thomas knows his father will always be there for him. In ways, that too frustrates him.</p><p>@UUID[.oSlIkegp0QsP6w30]{Myrdina Bogg} - Myrdina and Young Franklin have been friends for a long time, and have gotten out of more trouble together than most people get into to begin with. Her absence was felt keenly while she was away, and her return brought an eager reconnection—including a return of some of the pranks and foolishness that they once got up to. While Myrdina aged out of some of the impulsive and reckless behavior of their shared youth, drifting away from the overconsumption of alcohol and the inveterate gambling, Thomas still hasn't. Unbeknownst to the younger Franklin, the apothecary would dearly like to see him start.</p><p>@UUID[.jEwfmvZv0z5uNRjc]{Tur Thorndrake} - Thomas, whether he realizes it himself or not, truly wants the approval of the dragonborn guard captain. He even put in effort to try and join the militia, though he found the exercises too grueling and the outfits too chafing and quit after he got a spear splinter in his palm that required Myrdina's intervention to extract. Thomas has had drinks with the older, seasoned veteran and at times listens to the stories he tells with rapt attention—but with the certain knowledge that he won't ever have a life that grand. Still, Young Franklin values the mentorship of the retired warrior, and looks forward to their chats.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"ferncombe.FerncombeJournalSheet"}}},{"sort":1750000,"name":"Connections","type":"text","_id":"4qmZSowB2K9TYehe","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>@UUID[.hRtimGuKCKAdL05h]{Albert Glinn} - Compared to the bond of friendship Tur forged with many others, from the time Tur first set foot in Ferncombe Tur and Albert had a very slow and rocky friendship.

Though the pair have similar social personas, and Tur would never share this thought with others, he believes Albert puts too much effort into appearing kind and friendly without actually being kind and friendly.</p><p>@UUID[.uOAPIMRCvFulZBZv]{Caitlin Cartwright} - Tur and Caitlin became fast friends and share a kind of mutual respect and kindred altruism. Often, after Cait's Rest has closed up for the night, the two will share a quiet drink together in celebration of the night's closing—provided there are no guests or other visitors staying past closing time. It isn't a romantic entanglement of any sort, but more of a quiet companionship ritual in recognition of each other's efforts for the betterment of the town.</p><p>@UUID[.hG46SU0MlF900kRp]{Lileja Horsetender} - Perhaps one of the few people in town that Tur gives a wide berth. He knows her by her craft, her reputation, and her manner and he prefers she not look too hard at his equipment.

For his part, Tur is always happy to enjoy Mette's company and attention, and the pair have been seen walking together and sharing the news of the day from time to time as the sun sets, leading to rumors of a tryst—rumors which Tur has tried to quell, which in turn only caused them to spread further.</p><p>@UUID[.adY1gf0dUcenHugc]{Skipper Ginz} - Old prejudices die hard, and for all Skipper and the kobolds are contributing members of the town, Tur has a lot of trouble with his bias. While the dragonborn would love to be able to reconcile his past encounters with kobolds with the clear dissonance the Ginz family represents, he simply cannot get past his distrust.</p><p>The cultural trend toward worship of dragons runs deep in Kobolds and Tur knows it, and for all Skipper might avoid the cultism more common in his kind, there have been hints that his family harbor a sort of worship toward the 'benevolent dragon-walker'. The fact that anyone might see him as something to be worshiped and revered makes Tur wholly uncomfortable, especially these particular townsfolk. After once discovering a shrine the kobolds erected using a few minor missing belongings of his, Tur makes efforts to periodically check that Skipper is steering his kin away from the practice.</p><p>For Skipper's part he does his best to play it straight when the councilor is around. The pair share an uneasy and unspoken agreement to stay out of one another's way. For all Tur tries to cleave toward kindness, when it comes to Skipper, he struggles to hide his discomfort.</p><p>@UUID[.ibNobrbIosJbxjAs]{Thomas Franklin Sr.} - Tur enjoys Old Franklin's company and, in fact, met the man during some of his earlier forays in business. They visited some of the same towns in their youth, and Tur is always happy to spend some time reminiscing on mutual acquaintances. Franklin doesn't remember much of Tur other than the fact he appeared a capable warrior, and out of respect for the man's tendency to avoid talk of his soldiering, likewise steers clear of topics too close to the violent past.</p><p>@UUID[.oAwiNskO7s2CtyVc]{Thomas Franklin Jr.} - Tur may not respect young Franklin to the same degree as his father, but he would like to. He has, on frequent occasion, tried to aid Old Franklin by trying to make the younger man more respectable—and while it may not have much effect, the pair do enjoy a sort of mentorship. Tur even tried to wrangle the salesman into the militia, and though he tried his best to put the effort in, Young Franklin's tendency toward trying to find shortcuts made him not a particularly worthy candidate.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"ferncombe.FerncombeJournalSheet"}}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"1y2YwwDKXlhe8xOf":3},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"ferncombe.FerncombeJournalSheet","viewMode":2,"sourceId":"JournalEntry.jLCxEGeWDd5mPxFx"},"exportSource":{"world":"a-town-called-ferncombe","system":"dnd5e","coreVersion":"10.288","systemVersion":"2.0.3"},"ferncombe":{"sidebar-sections":true}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1662137001830,"modifiedTime":1684889674121,"lastModifiedBy":"1y2YwwDKXlhe8xOf"},"folder":"gx96O5MrAwFFpeKC","sort":200000,"_id":"7tIP6rdWQzQ31L2K"},{"folder":"gx96O5MrAwFFpeKC","name":"Todo","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"Todo","type":"text","_id":"ZaiHJa0u5M626P6o","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>You can write //TODO anywhere in a journal if you want to leave yourself a reminder, then run this macro to find them again:@UUID[Macro.7yPy64bUxeYQ8xEx]{Journal Text Search}</p><p>Some general bullet points</p><ul><li><p>We have a few fonts/assets we will want to remove from the module once we confirm they are not in use</p></li><li><p>We need to place Drew's art in the module and create a scene for it</p></li><li><p>Should we put the credits in as a journal page?

Ferncombe simply doesn't see enough travelers to justify an inn of its size existing— but Oden had a dream, and wanted to build a place that all the townsfolk of Ferncombe could call home. Not long after the events that claimed Raventree Manor, with no lord to handle land deeds, Oden conspired with several of the townsfolk to declare himself the owner of a sizeable parcel of vacant lots originally earmarked for a town square in the middle of Ferncombe. With no one to challenge him and the townsfolk willing to swear to his having been issued the deed, everyone pitched in willingly to create the largest inn many of them had ever seen— something to rival the kind of tavern and boarding house that a city would support.</p><p>A few years after the tavern's completion, a wandering nobleman passing through spent several days in Oden's Rest. He was friendly, and warm, and kind, and asked a lot of questions about the manor and what transpired there. Discovering Oden was an avid player of chess, he challenged the tavern owner to play, and they became fast friends. Over time, the stranger would return time and again for a night of companionship and games, with friendly wagers.</p><p>For his part, Oden only ever won once, but it was the most important win of his life. Often when they would barter their wagers, the stranger would jokingly suggest Oden bet his soul. This night, knowing he had grown ill and having consumed a great deal of liqour, he did—balanced against the stranger offering to serve as a patron for the tavern for 'the rest of time' so that the inn would always turn a profit.</p><p>Ever since that night, Vostolas has been periodically visiting the tavern. He has a fondness for the place, and views it as paying a debt. He can rarely be found there, in disguise as a wealthy mortal man under the name \"Johann Georg\". Many of the townsfolk view him as a friend, and believe him to be a wealthy world-travelling lord of some sort.

Some, like the @UUID[JournalEntry.7tIP6rdWQzQ31L2K.JournalEntryPage.KMr83uy24Xctrihn]{Bogg} family, might have a longer history in the town, and others, like the @UUID[JournalEntry.7tIP6rdWQzQ31L2K.JournalEntryPage.fuivV7zhy44oKBmZ]{Ginnz Kobolds} are very large, but all of them are- at the end of the day- Ferncombe folk.</p><h3>The Ironshank Family</h3><p class=\"important\"><em>Where given the freedom, one must make things better.</em></p><p>The Ironshank family, Ferncombe's most recent arrivals, constitute the entirety of the town's dwarven population. They only recently descended from the mountains, and rumors claim they were exiled- though that is only half true.</p><p><strong>Samuel</strong> <em>\"The Fisher\"</em> is a burly, unhappy man who lives across the road with his wife and daughter Cira. He's an old soldier that was exiled by his people and set out to live under the sky and live a quiet life as a fisher. Though he's not a member of town guard he is potentially as dangerous as Tur Thorndrake, though he favors stealth over open assault.</p><p><strong>Raschak</strong> <em>\"Roughneck\"</em> is lean, muscular, and fiery. He is a loud-mouthed idealist who believes that defensive or military service to a people is a cause, an obligation that all members of a community should take part in. To date he has failed to convince the town leadership to make compulsory service in the militia law, but that doesn't stop him trying. He serves as Turn Thorndrake's right hand when it comes to training and organizing the militia.</p><h3>The Halfling Community</h3><p class=\"important\"><em>Drinkers and carousers, the likes you've never seen!</em></p><p>Ferncombe is home to a large contingent of goodly halflings who are a friendly, hardworking sort. They toil all day on farms and boats, and at sunset they trudge home to bathe and change before gathering at Cait's rest as a grand assembly of rowdy carousers.</p><p>Despite only being a little more than a tenth of the town's total population they are the source of better than half of Cait's income, and she treats them well, having ordered special furniture and kitchenware to accommodate their sort.</p><p>They in turn serve as the raucous beating heart of the in, showing newcomers a grand time, and plying strangers with endless drink and requests for their life's curiosities. Their interests are only good-natured, as they have heard every one of Tur's tales, and heard every song the town's bands have to play. So instead they are a rowdy band of extroverts, seeking excitement in others.</p><p>They don't let up until the night ends and the next day begins, releasing their victims to blissful, drunken sleep before wandering home themselves to get a bit of sleep before dawn and the new workday.</p><p>How they manage to get anything done after their nightly benders is a mystery, and the halflings simply claim that their stout constitutions are to thank. The only folk they can't outdrink are dwarves, and they say that's only because they've got a solid 150 pounds on the average halfling.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"ferncombe.FerncombeJournalSheet"}}}],"folder":"gx96O5MrAwFFpeKC","sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":0,"1y2YwwDKXlhe8xOf":3},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"ferncombe.FerncombeJournalSheet"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1684819305915,"modifiedTime":1684889294128,"lastModifiedBy":"1y2YwwDKXlhe8xOf"},"_id":"k5b3J8XntDD4aDgY"}],"scenes":[{"name":"Ferncombe","active":false,"navigation":true,"navOrder":0,"navName":"","background":{"src":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"foreground":null,"foregroundElevation":20,"thumb":null,"width":4000,"height":3000,"padding":0.25,"initial":{"x":null,"y":null,"scale":null},"backgroundColor":"#999999","grid":{"type":0,"size":200,"color":"#000000","alpha":0.2,"distance":5,"units":"ft"},"tokenVision":true,"fogExploration":true,"fogReset":1684610375268,"globalLight":false,"globalLightThreshold":null,"darkness":0,"fogOverlay":null,"fogExploredColor":null,"fogUnexploredColor":null,"drawings":[],"tokens":[],"lights":[],"notes":[],"sounds":[],"templates":[],"tiles":[],"walls":[],"playlist":null,"playlistSound":null,"journal":null,"journalEntryPage":null,"weather":"","folder":"5ySwzSsQaw42vIsX","sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":0,"1y2YwwDKXlhe8xOf":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Scene.OgIfOnTbKl259BBp"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1684610375276,"modifiedTime":1684891097059,"lastModifiedBy":"1y2YwwDKXlhe8xOf"},"_id":"OgIfOnTbKl259BBp"}],"tables":[],"macros":[{"name":"Journal Text Search","type":"script","author":"1y2YwwDKXlhe8xOf","img":"icons/magic/symbols/clover-luck-white-green.webp","scope":"global","command":"const inputDialog = new Dialog({\n    title: \"Find Text in Journals\",\n    content: `<label for=\"toFind\">Text to Find</label><input id=\"toFind\" name=\"toFind\" type=\"text\">`,\n    buttons: {\n        find: {\n        label: \"Find Text in Journal\",\n        callback: (html) => findItems(html),\n        icon: `<i class=\"fas fa-check\"></i>`\n        }\n    }\n}).render(true);\n\nasync function findItems(html) {\n    let toFind = html.find(\"#toFind\").val();\n    let results = \"\";\n    for (let journal of game.journal) {\n        for (let page of journal.pages) {\n            if ( page.type !== \"text\" || !page.text.content ) continue;\n            const text = page.text.content;\n            if ( text.includes(toFind) ) results += `<p><a class=\"content-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-uuid=\"${page.uuid}\" data-id=\"${page.id}}\">` + page.name + `</a></p>`;\n        }\n    }\n    const breakdown = new Dialog({\n        title: \"In The Following Locations\",\n        content: results,\n        buttons: {}\n    }).render(true);\n}","ownership":{"default":0,"xOsB85wXI0jTccyw":3,"ztvmi1o6YUITPdRl":3,"1y2YwwDKXlhe8xOf":3},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"house-divided","system":"dnd5e","coreVersion":"10.287","systemVersion":"2.0.3"},"core":{"sourceId":"Macro.x36Qb4BnqMvr71xm"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1666803364376,"modifiedTime":1684890795941,"lastModifiedBy":"1y2YwwDKXlhe8xOf"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"7yPy64bUxeYQ8xEx"}],"cards":[],"playlists":[],"folders":[{"name":"Ferncombe","sorting":"a","folder":null,"type":"JournalEntry","description":"","sort":0,"color":"#517b51","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Folder.gx96O5MrAwFFpeKC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1684891083037,"lastModifiedBy":"1y2YwwDKXlhe8xOf"},"_id":"gx96O5MrAwFFpeKC"},{"name":"Ferncombe","sorting":"a","folder":null,"type":"Scene","description":"","sort":0,"color":"#517b51","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Folder.5ySwzSsQaw42vIsX"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1684891096214,"lastModifiedBy":"1y2YwwDKXlhe8xOf"},"_id":"5ySwzSsQaw42vIsX"}],"_id":"3SLlEPjBKIvmVqsv","flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1684611911643,"modifiedTime":1684891107692,"lastModifiedBy":"1y2YwwDKXlhe8xOf"}}
